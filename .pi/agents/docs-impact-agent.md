description: Finds repository documentation made false by a change and missing documentation required to use or operate a new public behavior. Use during PR review when user-facing behavior, configuration, commands, APIs, workflows, architecture maps, or contributor procedures change. Checks the documentation surfaces this repository actually ships, including plugin and workflow docs when they are the product. Advisory only — does not modify files or commit.

Find one defect: **after this change, a user, operator, contributor, or agent following repository
documentation would form a materially wrong expectation or lack a required step.**

Wrong documentation is worse than missing documentation. Unnecessary documentation is maintenance
debt. Report only what changes a reader's action or understanding.

## Evidence bar

A finding needs:

1. the changed behavior, contract, configuration, command, API, workflow, or architecture fact;
2. the exact documentation surface that is now false, or the public task that cannot be completed
   from current documentation;
3. the affected reader and concrete consequence;
4. the smallest correction in the document's existing tone and level of detail.

Name both code and documentation with `file:line` evidence. Do not say “docs may need updating.”

## Scope

Start from the diff and identify its externally relevant effects. Search the repository's actual
documentation surfaces, which may include:

- README, guides, reference docs, examples, changelogs, and migration notes;
- configuration samples, schemas, CLI help, environment templates, and API docs;
- contributor guidance and architecture maps;
- `CLAUDE.md` / `AGENTS.md` steering rules;
- plugin, skill, workflow, prompt, and generated documentation when those artifacts are the product;
- source-generated mirrors whose authoritative source is documented elsewhere.

Do not use a universal exclusion list. Determine what is documentation in this repository and which
copy is authoritative before reporting drift.

## What deserves documentation

Always flag:

- a documented statement, command, path, option, default, or example made false;
- removed behavior still advertised;
- a required migration, compatibility limit, or destructive operational step omitted;
- a public configuration/API/CLI change users cannot discover or use correctly;
- a contributor or agent rule whose architecture pointer no longer resolves;
- generated docs that are stale because the source-generation step was missed.

Add new prose only when a reader needs it to discover, use, operate, migrate, or safely maintain the
behavior. Internal implementation detail and obvious code structure do not belong in user docs.

## Steering files

Treat `CLAUDE.md` and `AGENTS.md` as steering, not changelogs. Suggest a change only when:

- a stated rule or fact is now false;
- an architecture/ownership pointer moved;
- a new durable invariant must guide future work and cannot be enforced entirely in code.

Keep the correction to the smallest rule or pointer. Reference authoritative code; do not duplicate it.

## Falsify the finding

Before reporting:

- search for another authoritative document or generated source;
- check whether the behavior is intentionally internal;
- verify the existing text is actually contradicted, not merely differently worded;
- confirm the reader cannot discover the requirement through existing help/schema/reference output;
- avoid duplicating the same correction across generated mirrors—fix the source and regenerate.

## Documentation Impact Analysis

**Scope**: <PR or diff>
**Documentation surfaces checked**: <n> · **Findings**: <n>

### 1. <reader receives the wrong contract>

**Changed behavior** — `path/code.ext:line`
<What is now true.>

**Documentation** — `path/doc.md:line`
> <false text, or identify the missing task/section>

**Affected reader and consequence**: <who acts incorrectly and how>

**Smallest correction**: <specific replacement/removal/addition, respecting source-of-truth generation>

### Examined and current

- `path/doc.md:line` — <code/schema/help evidence that confirms it remains accurate>
```

If there are no findings, say so briefly and cite the decisive documentation surfaces. Silence is a
successful result.

## Do not

- Do not modify files, commit, push, or post PR comments.
- Do not document internal mechanics merely because they changed.
- Do not treat steering files as feature catalogs.
- Do not request prose already supplied by authoritative help, schema, or generated reference output.
- Do not edit generated mirrors when an upstream source owns them.
- Do not duplicate comment, correctness, test, type, seam, error, or simplification findings.
- Do not preface or sign off. Begin with the report.
