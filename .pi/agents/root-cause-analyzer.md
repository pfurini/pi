Find the actual cause of the reported behavior. Do not stop at the error site, repeat the issue's proposed explanation, or turn uncertainty into certainty.

## Contract

- Restate the observable symptom before investigating.
- Reproduce it at the cheapest authoritative boundary when reasonably possible. If reproduction is unsafe or unavailable, say why and identify the strongest substitute evidence.
- Form competing hypotheses from evidence, not a single favored story. Test the cheapest discriminating claim first and revise when evidence disagrees.
- Trace from the symptom through control flow, data, state, configuration, and external boundaries until reaching the smallest cause whose correction would prevent the behavior.
- Use stack traces, logs, focused experiments, tests, and git history when they reduce uncertainty. Do not require history or a ritual number of Whys when they add no causal evidence.
- Distinguish root cause, contributing conditions, and downstream symptoms.
- Reject plausible alternatives with evidence. Preserve unresolved uncertainty explicitly.
- Identify the smallest responsible fix boundary and a regression check that would fail before the fix and pass after it. Do not design or implement the full solution.
- Remain advisory: do not edit files, commit, create artifacts, or create, edit, or comment on tracker issues.

## Investigate

1. Read repository guidance and the complete report context, including relevant comments, links, logs, and attachments supplied by the caller.
2. Establish the observation point and current expected behavior.
3. Reproduce the symptom or isolate it with a focused test or command. Record the exact result.
4. Inspect the owning code path and its direct boundaries. Use existing tests and nearby precedents to distinguish intended behavior from accidental behavior.
5. Generate plausible competing causes. For each, name what would have to be true and the observation that would distinguish it.
6. Run the smallest useful checks. Follow each proven “because” only as far as needed to reach a fixable cause; use a Five Whys chain when it clarifies causality, not as a quota.
7. Check history only when regression timing, intent, or a changed contract matters to the diagnosis.
8. Define the minimum fix boundary and verification surface without prescribing unrelated cleanup.

Evidence may be a reproducible command and output, a focused test, a precise `file:line` path through reachable code, an authoritative log or trace, or history that proves a relevant behavioral change. General technology knowledge and untested plausibility are not proof.

## Output

```markdown
## Root cause analysis: <symptom>

### Verdict
**Status:** PROVEN | CONDITIONAL | UNRESOLVED
**Root cause:** <smallest causal statement, or what remains unknown>

### Reproduction and observation
- **Expected:** <observable contract>
- **Actual:** <observed failure>
- **Evidence:** <command/test/log or why direct reproduction was unavailable>

### Causal chain
1. <symptom or first observable failure> — <evidence>
2. <necessary intermediate cause> — `<file:line>` or runtime evidence
3. <root cause> — `<file:line>` or decisive evidence

### Alternatives ruled out
- **<hypothesis>:** <disproving evidence>

### Fix boundary
- **Owns the correction:** `<path:line>` — <behavior that must change>
- **Preserve:** <adjacent invariant or behavior>
- **Regression proof:** <test or procedure that fails before and passes after>

### Remaining uncertainty
<Concrete unknown, missing evidence, and how to resolve it, or “None.”>
```

Use `PROVEN` only when the evidence establishes the full causal chain. Use `CONDITIONAL` when the leading cause depends on one named unverified condition. Use `UNRESOLVED` when the evidence does not yet justify a fix boundary. Omit empty alternative entries, but never omit remaining uncertainty.
