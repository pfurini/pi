name: prp-plan
description: Create a comprehensive, context-rich feature implementation plan. Also wires bidirectional back/forward references between existing plans (the update-references workflow). Use when the user wants to plan a feature, turn a PRD into an implementation plan, "link two plans", "add a back/forward reference", "connect related plans", or invokes /prp-plan.

---

<objective>
Transform "$ARGUMENTS" into a battle-tested implementation plan through systematic codebase exploration, pattern extraction, and strategic research.

**Core Principle**: PLAN ONLY - no code written. Create a context-rich document that enables one-pass implementation success.

**Execution Order**: CODEBASE FIRST, RESEARCH SECOND. Solutions must fit existing patterns before introducing new ones.

**Agent Strategy**: specialized subagents gather intelligence in Phases 2, 3, and 5; their roles and exact prompts live in `references/agent-prompts.md`.
</objective>

<context>
**Directory Discovery** (run these to understand project structure):
- List root contents: `ls -la`
- Find main source directories: `ls -la */ 2>/dev/null | head -50`
- Identify project type from config files (package.json, pyproject.toml, Cargo.toml, go.mod, etc.)

**IMPORTANT**: Do NOT assume `src/` exists. Common alternatives include:
- `app/` (Next.js, Rails, Laravel)
- `lib/` (Ruby gems, Elixir)
- `packages/` (monorepos)
- `cmd/`, `internal/`, `pkg/` (Go)
- Root-level source files (Python, scripts)

Discover the actual structure before proceeding.
</context>

<process>

## Mode Select

Before planning, check intent:

- **Link / connect two existing plans** — the request is to wire a back/forward reference between plans (e.g. "link plan A to plan B", "this plan builds on that one", `update-references <plan> <related> [back|forward]`). → Follow `workflows/update-references.md` and stop. Do NOT run the planning phases below.
- **Revise from a review report** — the input contains or references a `/prp-plan-review` report (a `reviews/*-review.md` path or pasted review findings) against an existing plan. → Follow `workflows/revise-from-review.md` and stop. Do NOT regenerate the plan through the phases below.
- **Create / update a plan** (the default) — anything that describes a feature, hands over a PRD, or otherwise asks for an implementation plan. → Continue with Phase 0 below.

---

## Phase 0: DETECT - Input Type Resolution

**Determine input type:**

| Input Pattern | Type | Action |
|---------------|------|--------|
| Ends with `.prd.md` | PRD file | Parse PRD, select next phase |
| Ends with `.md` and contains "Implementation Phases" | PRD file | Parse PRD, select next phase |
| File path that exists | Document | Read and extract feature description |
| Free-form text | Description | Use directly as feature input |
| Empty/blank | Conversation | Use conversation context as input |

### If PRD File Detected:

1. **Read the PRD file**
2. **Parse the Implementation Phases table** - find rows with `Status: pending`
3. **Check dependencies** - only select phases whose dependencies are `complete`
4. **Select the next actionable phase:**
   - First pending phase with all dependencies complete
   - If multiple candidates with same dependencies, note parallelism opportunity

5. **Extract phase context:**
   ```
   PHASE: {phase number and name}
   GOAL: {from phase details}
   SCOPE: {from phase details}
   SUCCESS SIGNAL: {from phase details}
   PRD CONTEXT: {problem statement, user, hypothesis from PRD}
   ```

6. **Report selection to user:**
   ```
   PRD: {prd file path}
   Selected Phase: #{number} - {name}

   {If parallel phases available:}
   Note: Phase {X} can also run in parallel (in separate worktree).

   Proceeding with Phase #{number}...
   ```

### If Free-form or Conversation Context:

- Proceed directly to Phase 1 with the input as feature description

**PHASE_0_CHECKPOINT:**
- [ ] Input type determined
- [ ] If PRD: next phase selected and dependencies verified
- [ ] Feature description ready for Phase 1

---

## Phase 1: PARSE - Feature Understanding

**EXTRACT from input:**

- Core problem being solved
- User value and business impact
- Feature type: NEW_CAPABILITY | ENHANCEMENT | REFACTOR | BUG_FIX
- Complexity: LOW | MEDIUM | HIGH
- Affected systems list

**FORMULATE user story:**

```
As a <user type>
I want to <action/goal>
So that <benefit/value>
```

**PHASE_1_CHECKPOINT:**

- [ ] Problem statement is specific and testable
- [ ] User story follows correct format
- [ ] Complexity assessment has rationale
- [ ] Affected systems identified

**GATE**: If requirements are AMBIGUOUS → STOP and ASK user for clarification before proceeding.

---

## Phase 2: EXPLORE - Codebase Intelligence

**CRITICAL: Launch two specialized agents in parallel using multiple Task tool calls in a single message.** Read `references/agent-prompts.md` now (mandatory) — it is the exact prompt text for every subagent launch in Phases 2, 3, and 5.

- **Agent 1: `codebase-explorer`** — finds WHERE code lives and extracts implementation patterns. Launch with the Phase 2 codebase-explorer prompt.
- **Agent 2: `codebase-analyst`** — analyzes HOW integration points work and traces data flow. Launch with the Phase 2 codebase-analyst prompt.

### Merge Agent Results

Combine findings from both agents into a unified discovery table:

| Category | File:Lines                                  | Pattern Description  | Code Snippet                              |
| -------- | ------------------------------------------- | -------------------- | ----------------------------------------- |
| NAMING   | `src/features/X/service.ts:10-15`           | camelCase functions  | `export function createThing()`           |
| ERRORS   | `src/features/X/errors.ts:5-20`             | Custom error classes | `class ThingNotFoundError`                |
| LOGGING  | `src/core/logging/index.ts:1-10`            | getLogger pattern    | `const logger = getLogger("domain")`      |
| TESTS    | `src/features/X/tests/service.test.ts:1-30` | describe/it blocks   | `describe("service", () => {`             |
| TYPES    | `src/features/X/models.ts:1-20`             | Drizzle inference    | `type Thing = typeof things.$inferSelect` |
| FLOW     | `src/features/X/service.ts:40-60`           | Data transformation  | `input → validate → persist → respond`    |

**PHASE_2_CHECKPOINT:**

- [ ] Both agents (`codebase-explorer` and `codebase-analyst`) launched in parallel and completed
- [ ] At least 3 similar implementations found with file:line refs
- [ ] Code snippets are ACTUAL (copy-pasted from codebase, not invented)
- [ ] Integration points mapped with data flow traces
- [ ] Every surface that reads or exposes the changed state is enumerated (all enumerators, caches, mirrors)
- [ ] Dependencies cataloged with versions from package.json

---

## Phase 3: RESEARCH - External Documentation

**ONLY AFTER Phase 2 is complete** - solutions must fit existing codebase patterns first.

**Launch `web-researcher`** with the Phase 3 web-researcher prompt from `references/agent-prompts.md`, filling in the feature description and the dependency versions found in Phase 2.

**FORMAT the agent's findings into plan references:**

```markdown
- [Library Docs v{version}](https://url#specific-section)
  - KEY_INSIGHT: {what we learned that affects implementation}
  - APPLIES_TO: {which task/file this affects}
  - GOTCHA: {potential pitfall and how to avoid}
```

**External capability check**: when a planned behavior or acceptance criterion depends on a capability of an external package or companion repository, verify the capability exists at the pinned version by reading its actual source (node_modules or the checked-out repo) — documentation and memory of the API do not count. A capability you cannot verify is a decision-required item for Phase 5.5, not an assumption to build on.

**PHASE_3_CHECKPOINT:**

- [ ] `web-researcher` agent launched and completed
- [ ] Documentation versions match package.json
- [ ] URLs include specific section anchors (not just homepage)
- [ ] Gotchas documented with mitigation strategies
- [ ] No conflicting patterns between external docs and existing codebase
- [ ] Every external capability the plan depends on was verified in the pinned version's source

---

## Phase 4: DESIGN - UX Transformation

**CREATE ASCII diagrams showing user experience before and after, then DOCUMENT interaction changes.** Read `templates/ux-diagram-format.md` now (mandatory) — it is the exact BEFORE/AFTER diagram shape and interaction-changes table to produce.

**PHASE_4_CHECKPOINT:**

- [ ] Before state accurately reflects current system behavior
- [ ] After state shows ALL new capabilities
- [ ] Data flows are traceable from input to output
- [ ] User value is explicit and measurable

---

## Phase 5: ARCHITECT - Strategic Design

**For complex features with multiple integration points**, use `codebase-analyst` to trace how existing architecture works at the integration points identified in Phase 2 — launch with the Phase 5 architecture deep-dive prompt from `references/agent-prompts.md`.

**Then ANALYZE deeply (use extended thinking if needed):**

- ARCHITECTURE_FIT: How does this integrate with the existing architecture?
- EXECUTION_ORDER: What must happen first → second → third?
- FAILURE_MODES: Edge cases, race conditions, error scenarios?
- PERFORMANCE: Will this scale? Database queries optimized?
- SECURITY: Attack vectors? Data exposure risks? Auth/authz?
- MAINTAINABILITY: Will future devs understand this code?

**DECIDE and document:**

```markdown
APPROACH_CHOSEN: [description]
RATIONALE: [why this over alternatives - reference codebase patterns]

ALTERNATIVES_REJECTED:

- [Alternative 1]: Rejected because [specific reason]
- [Alternative 2]: Rejected because [specific reason]

NOT_BUILDING (explicit scope limits):

- [Item 1 - explicitly out of scope and why]
- [Item 2 - explicitly out of scope and why]
```

**PHASE_5_CHECKPOINT:**

- [ ] Approach aligns with existing architecture and patterns
- [ ] Dependencies ordered correctly (types → repository → service → routes)
- [ ] Edge cases identified with specific mitigation strategies
- [ ] Each hooked seam's execution timing verified from source across initial, queued/deferred, retry, abort, and teardown paths
- [ ] Scope boundaries are explicit and justified

---

## Phase 5.5: CONFIRM - Decision Checkpoint

Phases 2-5 discover ambiguities the Phase 1 gate could not see. Before generating the plan, collect every assumption made so far that is NOT directly settled by the source requirements (PRD, issue, ADRs) or by verified codebase facts, and classify each:

| Class | Criteria | Action |
|-------|----------|--------|
| **decision-required** | Public API/wire-contract shape; scope or phase placement; behavior change or compatibility break; any weakening, strengthening, or omission of a behavior the source input commits to; any new or changed public setting; security/isolation policy interpretation; expensive or hard-to-reverse choices | Must be confirmed by the user before the plan is implementation-ready |
| **planner-default** | Reversible implementation detail with a clear, evidence-backed default | Decide it; disclose it under Questionables — no prompt |

A task block states exactly one design. Alternatives left in task text ("or …", "if needed", "choose one") are unclassified assumptions — resolve each through this checkpoint before generating the plan.

**If decision-required items exist, batch them into ONE interaction** — never drip questions one at a time. Present each item with the assumption taken, the rationale, and the alternatives. Then:

- **Answered** → record the decision with provenance ("confirmed by user") in the Phase 5 decision documentation (APPROACH_CHOSEN / NOT_BUILDING as appropriate). Confirmed items do NOT appear under Questionables.
- **User defers or cannot answer** → the item stays under Questionables prefixed `[DECISION REQUIRED]`, and the plan is a **DRAFT** (see Phase 6 and the report).

**Non-interactive runs** (headless pipeline, no user available): do not guess. Keep every decision-required item under Questionables prefixed `[DECISION REQUIRED]`, generate the plan as a DRAFT, and end the final reply with the sentinel line `PLAN: BLOCKED` followed by the open items. When there are no decision-required items, end with `PLAN: READY`.

If the input fully settles behavior and placement (e.g. an explicit PRD decision), ask nothing — a redundant question is a defect too.

**PHASE_5_5_CHECKPOINT:**

- [ ] All post-Phase-1 assumptions collected and classified
- [ ] Decision-required items either confirmed (with provenance) or marked `[DECISION REQUIRED]`
- [ ] No question asked that the source input already answers
- [ ] Every task states exactly one design — no alternatives left in task text

## Phase 6: GENERATE - Implementation Plan File

```bash
# --- PRP store resolver (canonical; keep byte-identical across skills) ---
_gd="$(git rev-parse --path-format=absolute --git-common-dir 2>/dev/null)"
case "$_gd" in */.git) _root="${_gd%/.git}" ;; "") _root="$PWD" ;; *) _root="$_gd" ;; esac
_root="$(cd "$_root" && pwd -P)"
_name="$(basename "$_root" | tr '[:upper:]' '[:lower:]' | tr -cs 'a-z0-9' '-' | sed 's/^-*//;s/-*$//')"
PRP_DIR="${PRP_HOME:-$HOME/.prp}/${_name:-project}-$(printf %s "$_root" | git hash-object --stdin | cut -c1-8)"
mkdir -p "$PRP_DIR"; [ -f "$PRP_DIR/project.json" ] || printf '{"path": "%s", "name": "%s"}\n' "$_root" "${_name:-project}" > "$PRP_DIR/project.json"
```

**OUTPUT_PATH**: `$PRP_DIR/plans/{kebab-case-feature-name}.plan.md`

Create directory if needed: `mkdir -p "$PRP_DIR/plans"`

**PLAN_STRUCTURE**: Read `templates/plan-template.md` now (mandatory) — it is the exact plan document to fill and save. Keep every section heading; fill every `{placeholder}` with real, project-specific content (the template's remaining snippets and table entries are illustrative examples from one TypeScript project, not content to keep). Before writing the plan's Step-by-Step Tasks section, read `references/task-block-format.md` (mandatory) for the task-block field detail and worked examples; before filling its Validation Commands section, read `references/validation-commands.md` (mandatory) for the per-language commands to embed.

</process>

<output>
**OUTPUT_FILE**: `$PRP_DIR/plans/{kebab-case-feature-name}.plan.md`

**If input was from PRD file**, also update the PRD:

1. **Update phase status** in the Implementation Phases table:
   - Change the phase's Status from `pending` to `in-progress`
   - Add the plan file path to the PRP Plan column

2. **Edit the PRD file** with these changes

**REPORT_TO_USER** (display after creating plan): Read `templates/report-format.md` now (mandatory) and display the "Plan Created" report in exactly that structure.

</output>

**FINAL_VALIDATION before saving plan:**

**CONTEXT_COMPLETENESS:**

- [ ] All patterns from `codebase-explorer` and `codebase-analyst` documented with file:line references
- [ ] External docs versioned to match package.json
- [ ] Integration points mapped with specific file paths
- [ ] Gotchas captured with mitigation strategies

**IMPLEMENTATION_READINESS:**

- [ ] Tasks ordered by dependency (can execute top-to-bottom)
- [ ] Each task is atomic and independently testable
- [ ] No placeholders - all content is specific and actionable
- [ ] Pattern references include actual code snippets (copy-pasted, not invented)
- [ ] No `[DECISION REQUIRED]` items remain under Questionables (Phase 5.5) — if any do, the plan is a DRAFT, not implementation-ready

**PATTERN_FAITHFULNESS:**

- [ ] Every new file mirrors existing codebase style exactly
- [ ] No unnecessary abstractions introduced
- [ ] Naming follows discovered conventions
- [ ] Error/logging patterns match existing
- [ ] Test structure matches existing tests

**VALIDATION_COVERAGE:**

- [ ] Every task has executable validation command
- [ ] All 6 validation levels defined where applicable
- [ ] Edge cases enumerated with test plans
- [ ] Every acceptance criterion's "Falsified by" entry names a check that fails when that criterion is violated
- [ ] Every planned diagnostic or warning names its concrete channel (event, sink, or return value) and has an assertion

**INTERNAL_CONSISTENCY:**

- [ ] Every file named in any task, test table, or validation command appears in Files to Change with the matching action
- [ ] Every task consumes only artifacts (files, exports, types) created by earlier tasks
- [ ] Every IMPORTS path resolves against the current tree and the imported symbol exists
- [ ] Every "already handled by X" claim was verified at a file:line
- [ ] Citations anchor on symbol names, with line numbers as secondary detail

**SOURCE_TRACEABILITY** (when the input was a PRD or spec):

- [ ] Every in-scope source commitment maps to a delivering task — including committed docs and migration-note deliverables
- [ ] Every task traces back to a source commitment or necessary plumbing
- [ ] Every deviation from a committed behavior (weakened, strengthened, or dropped) went through Phase 5.5
- [ ] No task edits the source document itself

**UX_CLARITY:**

- [ ] Before/After ASCII diagrams are detailed and accurate
- [ ] Data flows are traceable
- [ ] User value is explicit and measurable

**NO_PRIOR_KNOWLEDGE_TEST**: Could an agent unfamiliar with this codebase implement using ONLY the plan?
</verification>

<success_criteria>
**CONTEXT_COMPLETE**: All patterns, gotchas, integration points documented from actual codebase via `codebase-explorer` and `codebase-analyst` agents
**IMPLEMENTATION_READY**: Tasks executable top-to-bottom without questions, research, or clarification — and no `[DECISION REQUIRED]` Questionables (a plan carrying them is a DRAFT and must be reported as such)
**DECISIONS_CONFIRMED**: Every consequential post-Phase-1 assumption was either confirmed by the user (Phase 5.5) or is explicitly marked `[DECISION REQUIRED]` in a DRAFT plan — never silently finalized
**PATTERN_FAITHFUL**: Every new file mirrors existing codebase style exactly
**VALIDATION_DEFINED**: Every task has executable verification command
**UX_DOCUMENTED**: Before/After transformation is visually clear with data flows
**ONE_PASS_TARGET**: Confidence score 8+ indicates high likelihood of first-attempt success
