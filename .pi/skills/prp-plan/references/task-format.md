# Implementation Task Format

Write tasks as executable outcomes, not a file inventory. Size each task as the smallest coherent change that can be validated without leaving the system in a knowingly broken intermediate state.

A task pins what must hold — the invariant, the seam to touch (verified symbol plus `file:line`; symbol names survive line drift), and the falsifying test — not a prose script of the mechanism. Mechanism internals written in plan prose are unverified code that reviews must attack and that drifts stale; the implementer designs the mechanism against real code with the compiler and test suite the plan does not have. Reserve mechanism internals for designs several components must agree on, and verify every seam and pattern such a design cites in source first.

## Required content

```markdown
### N. <Outcome>

**Files and integration points**
- `path/file.ext:line` — CREATE / UPDATE — why this location owns the change

**Implementation**
- Concrete behavior, contract, state transition, or data flow to add or change.
- Existing primitive or pattern to reuse, with `file:line` evidence.
- Important boundary, failure behavior, or compatibility constraint.

**Tests**
- Behavior to prove and the appropriate test surface.

**Validation**
- `<focused command>` — expected observable result.
```

Use only fields that carry information. Add imports, types, schemas, migrations, or gotchas when they are load-bearing; do not repeat details an implementation agent can read directly from the cited file.

## Ordering and sizing

- Order tasks by real dependency and preserve a working integration path.
- Combine files that implement one coherent behavior; split work with a distinct contract or validation boundary.
- Describe the outcome first. A task named “Add workflow capability selection” is more useful than “Update five files.”
- Cite the closest useful precedent, not an arbitrary number of examples.
- Make tests part of the behavior they validate, unless shared test infrastructure genuinely has to land first.
- Use the repository's actual commands. A task-level command should fail when that task's behavior is absent.

## Avoid

- Status markers that no workflow maintains.
- “Mirror exactly” when the precedent contains a known poor convention.
- Generic edge-case checklists unrelated to the feature.
- Validation that proves only syntax when behavior changed.
- Optional implementation tasks that allow agreed scope to disappear.
- “Fail and move on.” A blocked task blocks completion until the scope or prerequisite is resolved.
