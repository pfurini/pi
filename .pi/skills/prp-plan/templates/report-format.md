# Plan Created — User Report

Lead with the recommendation, then provide the artifact and only the evidence useful for deciding whether to implement it.

```markdown
## Plan ready

{One or two sentences: recommended approach, invariant, and why this is the simplest supported shape.}

**Plan:** `{expanded absolute plan path}`

{If from a PRD:}
**Source:** `{PRD path}`, phase {number and name} — marked `in-progress` and linked

{If from an issue:}
**Source:** `{issue reference or URL}`
**Published plan:** `{verified issue comment URL}`

{If research or a spike decided the architecture:}
**Decisive evidence:** {source or spike verdict and absolute report path}

{If diagrams were included:}
**Visual review:** {UX flow, architecture, or both}

{If a minor decision remains:}
**Decision to confirm:** {recommendation and consequence}

{If decision-required items were deferred:}
**Status:** DRAFT — open `[DECISION REQUIRED]` items under Risks and Decisions: {items with recommendations}

**Next:** Implement with `/skill:prp-implement {expanded absolute plan path}` or its source issue reference.
```

Omit non-applicable lines. Never include a confidence score, file-count inventory, or generic complexity label. A non-interactive run additionally ends its final reply with `PLAN: READY`, or `PLAN: BLOCKED` plus the open items (see the design gate).
