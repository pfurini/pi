# Update PRD Phase

Maintain one source PRD's implementation lifecycle without changing its requirements or product decisions.

**Arguments:** $ARGUMENTS

## Resolve and verify

Require an explicit stage, PRD path, and phase number. Read the entire PRD and select the phase by its exact number, never by a fuzzy title match. Stop if the phase is missing, duplicated, or the requested transition conflicts with recorded state.

The Implementation Phases table must have `Plan`, `Report`, and `PR` columns. When reading an older PRD, rename `PRP Plan` to `Plan` and add missing columns without losing any row data or changing unrelated content.

## Apply the stage

- `planned` — require the plan file to exist. Set `Status` to `in-progress` and record its absolute path in `Plan`.
- `implemented` — require the plan and report files to exist and, when a PR URL is supplied, verify it identifies an open or merged PR for the current repository. Keep `Status` as `in-progress` and record the absolute plan path, absolute report path, and the PR URL when present (a local-flow delivery without a PR records `—`).
- `merged` — verify the phase's completion evidence: the recorded or supplied PR is merged (verified through GitHub), or — when the delivery recorded no PR — a `READY TO MERGE` review report exists at the canonical store path covering the phase's final plan. Set `Status` to `complete`, preserve all artifact links, and record the review report path in `PR` when it substitutes for one.

Never mark a phase complete merely because implementation passed or a PR exists. A phase implemented as multiple sequential plans completes only when every slice its row lists is delivered and the row's stated completion conditions hold — stop and report the outstanding slices otherwise. Never move status backward, replace a conflicting artifact silently, infer a phase number, or modify another phase. Repeating the same valid update must be harmless.

## Verify and report

Re-read the exact phase row after editing. Confirm its status and links match the requested stage and that the Markdown table remains valid. Return the PRD path, phase number, resulting status, and recorded links. Do not create a separate report artifact.
