# Review Report Contract

Write every review report in this shape. Omit empty finding rows, but keep all headings so humans and
downstream workflows can find the verdict and blocking categories reliably.

```markdown
---
pr: <number>
base: <base branch>
head: <head branch>
reviewed: <ISO timestamp>
verdict: <READY TO MERGE | NEEDS FIXES | REVIEW INCOMPLETE>
scopes: [code, seams, ...]
publication: <verified GitHub comment/review URL | pending>
---

# PR Review: #<number> — <title>

## Outcome

<One concise paragraph explaining what the PR changes and the review result.>

## Validation

| Command | Result | Evidence |
|---|---|---|
| `<actual command>` | PASS / FAIL / NOT RUN | <decisive detail> |

## Critical Issues (<count>)

| Agent | Finding | Evidence | Required change |
|---|---|---|---|
| `<agent>` | <concrete defect and impact> | `path:line` | <smallest valid correction> |

## Important Issues (<count>)

| Agent | Finding | Evidence | Required change |
|---|---|---|---|

## Suggestions (<count>)

| Agent | Suggestion | Evidence | Why consider it |
|---|---|---|---|

## Strengths

- <Specific behavior or implementation choice supported by the review.>

## Verdict

**<READY TO MERGE | NEEDS FIXES | REVIEW INCOMPLETE>**

<What must happen next, or why the PR is ready.>
```

Rules:

- Every Critical or Important finding needs a concrete impact and file:line evidence.
- Attribute findings to the agent that produced them; validation failures use `validation`.
- Keep suggestions genuinely optional. Never disguise a blocker as a suggestion or vice versa.
- Do not add generic praise, boilerplate checklists, confidence scores, or AI attribution.
- Write `publication: pending` before posting. After GitHub verification, replace it in the local report with the stable comment or review URL; downstream automation treats that URL as required delivery evidence.
