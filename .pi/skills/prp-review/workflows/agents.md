# Agent Review Workflow

Review the target PR through specialist agents, then publish one evidence-based summary.

## 1. Resolve the PR and context

Resolve a number, URL, branch, or the current branch's PR with `gh pr view` / `gh pr list`. Read its
title, body, author, state, base, head, files, reviews, comments, and complete diff.

- Stop when the PR is merged. Warn before reviewing a closed PR.
- Review a draft normally, but post a comment rather than approving or requesting changes.
- Check out the PR branch with `gh pr checkout` unless it is already checked out.
- Read repository guidance, the full changed files, and directly relevant tests and precedents.
- Read matching implementation reports, completed plans, or issue artifacts under `$PRP_DIR` when
  they exist. Treat documented deviations as context, not automatic defects.
- If the only matching artifact is under a legacy `.claude/PRPs/` path, stop and tell the user to
  run the PRP home-store migration.

Do not edit files, resolve conflicts, rebase, commit, or push. Review the PR as it exists.

## 2. Run repository validation

Discover authoritative checks from repository guidance, package scripts, task runners, and CI.
Run the applicable type check, lint, tests, build, and any focused validation the changed behavior
requires. Do not invent a generic command merely to fill a category.

Record the exact command, result, and decisive output. A missing or inapplicable check is `not run`,
not a pass. Distinguish a PR-caused failure from an unrelated or pre-existing failure when evidence
allows; otherwise report the uncertainty.

## 3. Select scopes

Always select `code` and `seams`. Add only scopes explicitly named by the user or calling workflow:

| Scope | Agent | Focus |
|---|---|---|
| `code` | `code-reviewer` | Correctness, repository rules, high-confidence defects |
| `seams` | `seam-analyzer` | Missing types, counterpart drift, bypassed boundaries |
| `tests` | `pr-test-analyzer` | Behavioral coverage and valuable regression protection |
| `comments` | `comment-analyzer` | Accuracy and long-term value of changed comments |
| `errors` | `silent-failure-hunter` | Swallowed failures, fallbacks, and actionable errors |
| `types` | `type-design-analyzer` | Invariant expression and enforcement in changed types |
| `docs` | `docs-impact-agent` | Stale or missing user and contributor documentation |
| `simplify` | `code-simplifier` | Avoidable machinery with a proven smaller primitive |

`all` adds all six optional scopes. Explicit `code` or `seams` is redundant but valid. Ignore
`--agents`; it exists only so older callers still receive the new default review.

## 4. Launch reviewers

Dispatch every selected agent in parallel when capacity permits, or sequentially when it does not. Every selected role remains required; wait for all of them before aggregation.
All agents are advisory and must not modify files or post their own PR comments.

When spawning each subagent:

**code-reviewer**:
> Review PR #<number> against its actual base for reachable behavioral defects and explicit repository-rule violations. Read direct callers and consumers beyond the diff. Report only causal findings with concrete evidence and file:line locations. Do not modify files, commit, or post comments.

**seam-analyzer**:
> Analyze PR #<number> for missing types at seams. Leave the diff to inspect direct counterparts of changed payloads, wire formats, persisted or resumed values, IPC/FFI and cross-language boundaries, syntax forms, validators, and synchronized enumerations. Enforce the two-sided evidence bar and documented carve-outs. Do not modify files, commit, or post comments.

**pr-test-analyzer**:
> Map changed behavior in PR #<number> to existing unit, integration, and end-to-end assertions. Report only gaps with a plausible faulty implementation that current tests allow and the smallest behavioral test that would catch it. Do not modify files, commit, or post comments.

**comment-analyzer**:
> Verify comments and docstrings changed by PR #<number> against actual code, contracts, and direct consumers. Report only materially false prose, a concrete maintenance trap, or missing durable knowledge that code and types cannot express. Do not modify files, commit, or post comments.

**silent-failure-hunter**:
> Trace changed failure and recovery paths in PR #<number>. Report only reachable failures that become indistinguishable from success or lose evidence needed by the owner who can act; respect legitimate probes, retries, fallbacks, and propagation. Do not modify files, commit, or post comments.

**type-design-analyzer**:
> Analyze new or modified types in PR #<number> for meaningful invariants they fail to enforce. Report only reachable invalid states with a concrete downstream consequence and the smallest proportional enforcement point. Do not modify files, commit, or post comments.

**docs-impact-agent**:
> Review repository documentation affected by PR #<number>. Report only materially false guidance or missing instructions required to discover, use, operate, migrate, or maintain changed public behavior. Determine this repository's real documentation surfaces and authoritative sources; do not treat steering files as changelogs. Do not modify files, commit, or post comments.

**code-simplifier**:
> Analyze PR #<number> for avoidable machinery. Establish the required outcome and invariant, find an existing or smaller primitive, and report only when evidence proves it can preserve the behavior while removing meaningful state, concepts, ownership, or synchronization. Do not modify files, commit, or post comments.

## 5. Aggregate without re-reviewing

Read `../templates/review-report.md` before writing. Merge duplicate findings, preserve meaningful
disagreement, and map agent language into the canonical severity categories. Do not invent findings,
raise severity without evidence, or perform another code review during aggregation.

Verdict rules:

- `READY TO MERGE`: no Critical or Important findings and all required validation passed.
- `NEEDS FIXES`: at least one Critical or Important finding, or a PR-caused required validation failure.
- `REVIEW INCOMPLETE`: required validation or decisive evidence could not be obtained.
- Suggestions, including every `simplify` finding, never block by themselves.

Write the report to the expanded absolute path `$PRP_DIR/reviews/pr-{NUMBER}-review.md`.

## 6. Publish and report

Post the complete, unabridged canonical report with `gh pr comment` by default. Use the same complete report body with `gh pr review --approve` only when `--approve`
was explicitly requested and the verdict is `READY TO MERGE`. Use `gh pr review --request-changes`
when explicitly requested or when the user explicitly asked the skill to submit blocking findings
as a formal review. Never formally approve or request changes on a draft.

Read the PR back to verify the comment or review exists and capture its stable URL. Replace `publication: pending` in the local canonical report with that URL, then re-read the report and GitHub state to verify both point to the same publication. Return the PR URL,
verdict, finding counts, validation summary, selected scopes, absolute report path, and comment URL.
